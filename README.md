# Best Restaurants Finder (Google Maps API)
- I have a personal problem and decided to solve it.
- In Yelp, you can only search for Top Rated or Most Reviewed. The problem with this is that Most Reviewed may be a 3.5 star place, and Top Reviewed is usually a new or obscure place with 1 review and 5 stars.
- In Google Maps, you can only search for Rating > n. No options to search by number of reviews.
- I literally can't believe theres no way to search for both. Ideally, you'd want to search for 1) total number of reviews > 500, and 2) Rating > 4 or 4.5 stars.
- A 3rd nice to have is 3) in my city or within 30 miles of my current location.
- I have implemented all 3 in my program here.
